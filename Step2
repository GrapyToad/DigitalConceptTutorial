After starting the tcp port 80 trace on WireShark, you should not see anything being captured. This is ok, because nothing is being recieved yet.
Open terminal and use the command "curl" on a remote server (eg. www.mit.edu). Doing this command should cause WireShark to start capturing data from the remote server.
